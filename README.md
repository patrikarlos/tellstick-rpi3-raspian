General place holder for wizdom.

So, this came about getting stuck re-installing the telldus-core on a Rpi3. After testing Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, arm64 and armhf, I ended up with Raspian 10, Buster. 

Googling/etc indicated that the combination of Tellstick-duo, RPi3 and software afer 2018 seemed to be challenging. So I tested a few approaches. 

The official, go for the source based version.
